Simulates various strategies used in blackjack. Currently based on one hard coded strategy matrix. I'll later implement a read-from-file method of importing selected strategies.

TODO:
- Implement feature to read from file to load strategies.
- Calculate actual house edges from the simulation.
- Hopeful feature: implement card counting strategies.

HOWTO:
- Compile and run from command line only. Add an integer argument to set the amount of shoes to be run.
